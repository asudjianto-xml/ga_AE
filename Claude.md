# Development Environment Configuration

## Python Virtual Environment

All Python code must use the virtual environment located at:
```
~/jupyterlab/ga_verify/venv/bin
```

## GPU Acceleration

- Use PyTorch with GPU acceleration as much as possible
- Leverage CUDA for all compatible operations
- Maximize GPU utilization for training and inference
